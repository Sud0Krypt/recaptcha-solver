Undetected Selenium Based Python Solver for Recaptcha Run main.py

## Features

Solves in about 10-20 seconds
config.json let's you customize a few options such as headerless browser and console prints

## Important

You must have ffmpeg Installed and added to PATH (This is required because of file conversion .mp3 -> .wav)
You can edit the code so it solves on ur own custom url
If you have any good suggestions feel free to open a ticket and I will add it in

Feel free to create PR If they're good I will merge them

## In Progress

I am thinking about making some parts of the code requests based so they not everything is done via browser this will make the program much faster (Not sure if i will add this yet though)
Additonal Notes

For some reason if you enable headerless browser option it becomes slower at solving not exactly sure why
You may need to Customize some of the iframe XPATH's if your trying to solve on another website than the one it's using
